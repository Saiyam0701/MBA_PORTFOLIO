# Commentary on Revisions and Use of LLM Output

I used the above LLM draft as a **starting point** and made several personalized updates:

- Rewrote the **About Me** section to better reflect my real voice, interests, and goals.
- Updated the **Education** section with actual institutions and dates.
- In the **Experience** section, I removed unrelated jobs and focused on relevant experience at Munimji Coaching Institute.
- Added my **real academic projects** completed during the MBA journey.
- Refined the **skills and certifications** to include what I actually possess (e.g., CCC, Leadership and Team Management, MS Office).

While the LLM helped generate structure and initial content, the final result is 100% personalized and authentic.
